## We start off with my Apple Sillicon MacBook Air,
I fu**ing love it! When i searched for a Laptop, i knew that i wanted something powerful, lightweight and thin, the first thing that caught my attention was the MacBook Air M1, it was released a year ago at the time and i loved it so i bought it instantly and i didn't regret it. Even though i came from Windows, it was suprisingly easy to use!
## Windows on M1,
two words: not supported. It's plain sad to see Linux and Windows not being supported on such great machines, it would improve the experience of some things, there was this game that we had on a computer in my school that i and everyone else would play religiously, i had the urge to download it one day but then it hit me, it was onky supported on Windows. That was pretty sad but i just moved on.
Fast forward about 4 months and i was looking for some games to play, nothing like AAA with amazing graphics, just something casual, NOTHING WAS SUPPORTED. My sadness increases.
Fast foeward again to a few weeks ago and i wanted to download Stray since everyone was talking about it and so i fired up Steam (was it steam?) and of course, IT'S NOT FUCKING SUPPORTED (no censorng to display my full anger.) and it's not just games too, oh no, you can find unsupported everything, even things that should be supported using Rosseta, aren't.
## Conclusion?
M1 is great, until it isn't. 
Side note, if you buy an Apple Sillicon mac, expect it to be obsolete in a year or two because the performance increase every new new Apple Sillicon chip brings. :)
