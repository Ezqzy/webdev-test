## To put it short and simple,
it's awful. Crashes, performance drops, snapchat maltfunctioning for some bizarre reason and MY CHARGING PORT FRYING ITSELF OUT OF NOWHERE. 
## Deep fried,
my charging port. it's a USB2 lightning connector mess, even more now since it fucking FRIED THE CONNECTORS (on a new iPhone 13 Mini!).
## So, what am i going to do with it?
Sell the goddamn thing and buy a new phone. This would be the most viable option for me, especially since amazing phones are being released!
### Option 1, Nothing Phone (1)
It's absolutely beautiful, And that price too, it's cheap for such a good phone, how great is that? 
### Option 2, Z Flip (4)
No one knows what it is, no one knows what it's price is or how it looks, but goddamn do i want it! 
### Option 3, Deal with it (no comment for this option)
